# Entur component library

The Entur component library is a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) based app with set of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components common for all Entur React applications.

It is served here: https://entur-component-library-ae8fd.firebaseapp.com

# Installation

```
npm install --save @entur/component-library
```

The component library depends on a small set of global definitions; typography and rem size. These rules are defined in `index.css`. For correct fonts add `@entur/fonts` to your `package.json`

```
"dependencies": {
  "@entur/fonts": "git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org:enturas/entur-fonts.git#a5e1956"
}
```

Remember to run npm install after adding the line.

You will also need to import the rules in your code:

```
// javascript
import '@entur/fonts/index.css'
import '@entur/component-library/lib/index.css'

// css
@import '~@entur/fonts/index.css'
@import '~@entur/component-library/lib/index.css'
```
